Count the number of times the word "noodle" appears in the [Noodle Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noodle). The count should include all matches, regardless of whether they appear in text, tags, or metadata.

Bonus: now do a case-insensitive count (or case-sensitive if you originally did case-insensitive).
